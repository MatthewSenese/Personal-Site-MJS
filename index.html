    <h3>Introduction</h3> <!--Here is an introduction to myself-->

    <h3>My Favorite Activity</h3> <!--Here is a list of my hobbies-->
    <p>
        As difficult as it is, I would have to say that my favorite activity would be swimming.<br>
        I have been swimming competitively for 13 years, and I am a captain on the Lewis swim team.<br>
        I can't see myself not swimming because of how much I enjoy doing it and how long I've been doing it.<br>
        <br>
        I also enjoy watching movies and going to concerts.<br>
        I've only started going to concerts regularly in the past year and a half, 
        but I really enjoy seeing my favorite artists perform live.
